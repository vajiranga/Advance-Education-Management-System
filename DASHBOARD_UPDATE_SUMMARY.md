# 🎨 EMS Dashboard Update Report

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Update:** Admin Dashboard Cards Redesign

---

## ✅ **Completed Updates**

### 1. **New Card Design**

- Applied modern gradient backgrounds (Blue, Green, Orange, Purple)
- Added white text for better contrast
- Implemented rounded corners and hover lift effects

### 2. **Large Number Display**

- **Dynamic Font Sizing**: The system now automatically adjusts font size based on the number length.
- **Billion Support**: Values like `LKR 1,500,000,000` will automatically size down slightly to fit perfectly, while smaller numbers remain huge.
- **Bold Typography**: Numbers are now much bolder and easier to read.

### 3. **Layout Improvements**

- All 4 cards are now equal width and height.
- Better spacing and alignment for icons and labels.
